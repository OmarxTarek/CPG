# Chess Piece Guide (CPG)

The Chess Piece Guide (CPG) is a discrete mathematics project developed for a college course. This Python application provides an interactive guide for learning about the movement rules of various chess pieces. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to navigate through different chess pieces, view their movement rules, and see visual representations of their moves on a 5x5 chessboard.

## Features

- **Selection Window**: Choose from a list of chess pieces to learn about their movement rules.
- **Image Display**: View images of the selected chess pieces.
- **Description Labels**: Read detailed descriptions of each chess piece's movement rules.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Easily navigate between different chess pieces.
- **Guide Window**: Open a detailed guide for each chess piece, including text descriptions and graphical representations of their moves.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize the movement of chess pieces on a 5x5 chessboard using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
